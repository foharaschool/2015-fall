<h3>Steps</h3>


<ul>
<li>Open this file in Firefox and jEdit</li>
<li>Add your name, section, and email</li>
<li>After the line: <code>YOUR CODE STARTS AFTER THIS LINE:</code> </li>
<li><b>Debug this program</b> using software error messages and/or the alert() method for help.</li>
<li><b>Also:  Bring to program up to the course scoding standards.</b> &nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color: red">Be sure to review the JavaScript coding standards. &nbsp; <b>Full credit cannot be received if coding standards violations remain in the program.</b></span></li>

<h3>The Program Planning Lists</h3>

<pre class="blackGreen">
The List of Input Variables:
    principle
    annualInterestPercentage


The List of Output Variables:
    principle
    annualInterestPercentage
    interestEarned
    principleWithAnnualEarnings


The Process Checklist:
    Declare all variables
    Obtain investment amount and interest rate
    Convert investment amount and interest rate to numeric format
    Convert interest rate to decimal form
    Calculate interest earned in one year
    Calculate new principle amount now with annual earnings
    Display initial principle, interest rate, earned interest, and     
            new principle
</pre>

<ul>
<li><strong>Sample Outputs:</strong></li>
</ul>



<pre class="blackGreen">
Results of your Investment Scenario are shown below:
----------------------------------------------------

If you invested $100 at an annual rate of 5%, then you would earn $5 in one year.
You would then have a total of $105 at the end of the year!
</pre>

<pre class="blackGreen">
Results of your Investment Scenario are shown below:
----------------------------------------------------

If you invested $300.33 at an annual rate of 5.7%, then you would earn $17.11881 in one year.
You would then have a total of $317.44881 at the end of the year!

// YOUR CODE STARTS AFTER THIS LINE:


    /*
    The purpose of this program is take in from the viewer an investment amount
    (the principle) and an annual interest rate (expressed as a percentage).
    It then calculates the amount of interest that would be earned, and the total
    amount the viewer would then have at the end of the year after the interest
    earnings had been added to the origiinal investment amount.
    
    The results are then to be displayed in the format as shown in to sample output.
    
    
    The program assumes the interest is credited only at the end of the year, and
    doesn't need to consider taxes nor inflation.  It also assumes that the viewer
    did enter numbers for the two inputs--no need to guard against the siuation in
    which the viewer does not enter numbers.  Also, there is no need to round anything
    in this program.
