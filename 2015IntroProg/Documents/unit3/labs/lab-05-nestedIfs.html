<h2>Part 1 problem statement</h2>

<blockquote><p>Write a program that creates a greeting based on an entered code and a name. Prompt the user for his/her name and for a code of A, B, C, or D. Output one of the following greetings.  Note:  Use the length property of string objects to make sure the user has keyed at least one character into the text boxes presented by the prompt method--display an error message if they entered nothing in either of the prompt text boxes.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Part 2 problem statement</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Write a program that asks a user to enter his/her favorite ice cream from the choices of vanilla, chocolate, or strawberry. If they choose vanilla, then ask them if they would like <span class="caps">M&amp;M</span>s or Reese's Pieces on top. If they choose chocolate, then ask them if they want brownies or walnuts on top. If they choose strawberry, then ask them if they want pecans or almonds on top. Finally, output what they've chosen.</p>
  <p>Note that for this Part 2, the program has been already partially coded for you. If you wish to delete this partial coding, and write the program using an alternative approach, that is fine.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Note: For this Part 2, the codes that the user will key in for the prompts are not specified in this Problem statement. You will be choosing those. A one-letter code witll be most convenient for the user--just be sure to tell the user on the prompt message what code they should key in for each of the possible choices.  (Also, you will have to decide if your program will accept both an upper and lower case code letter, or just one or the other.)</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Note: For this Part 2, the Program Planning Lists have been done for you. And a suggested version plan for implementation is also presented.</p>

<h3>Part 2 Version Plan - <span style="font-size: .8em">Note: This is just one plan; it could be done in fewer versions also.</span> </h3>



<pre class="blackGreen">
Version zero:

   The program will have VAR statements for constants and
   variables, and, an alert() method to test if the flow
   of control successfully enters the program.

Version 1:
    
   Next, the program's final section will be completed, testing
   to ensure that it is successfully writing the choice message
   for this user.  To test this, the variable holding the choice
   message will be temporarily just assigned some test content, 
   such as &quot;this is a test message.&quot;

Version 2:
    
   Next, the program will ask the user for his/her ice cream choice 
   via use of the prompt() method.  To test this, temporarily insert
   an alert() method right after the prompt to see what is in the
   variable holding the ice cream choice.
   
Version 3:
    
   Next, the program will now interrogate the ice cream choice
   variable via a linerarly nested IF.  To test if this IF is 
   working properly, temporarily place an alert() method with an
   approriate message into each of the conditionally executed
   blocks.  Don't forget to have an "else net" at the end to 
   catch the case of "none of the above," i.e. the user entered
   an invalid code.
   
Version 4a:
    
   Next, the program will include asking the user for his/her topping 
   choice, based on his/her ice cream choice.  Initially, do this just
   for the vanilla ice cream choice. To test this, temporarily insert
   an alert() method after the prompt to see what is in the variable
   holding the topping choice.

Version 4b:
    
   When the program is properly asking the user for a topping choice
   for vanilla, now add in this logic for the other two ice cream
   choices.  And again, temporarily use the alert() method to verify
   that the variable holding the topping choice is properly receiving
   the choice code.  

Version 5a:

   Now interrogate the ice cream choice and the topping choice to assign
   the appropriate message (see constants) into the 'choceMessageForThisUser'
   variable.  Do this first just for one combination, starting with a 
   vanilla choice and a M&Ms choice.  Place an "else net" on thie IF to
   catch the case of none of the abovve.  (Note:  we haven't done any
   validation on the topping choice codes--in effect, we are doing that now
   in this section of the program.)
   
Version 5b:

   Now add in the first of the "else IFs" to the conditional, so that the
   program now will handle vanilla ice cream, and both of the topping 
   choices.  
   
Version 5c:

   Now add in more "else IFs" to the conditional, so that the
   program now will handle chocolate ice cream, and both of the topping 
   choices.  
   
   
Version 5d:

   Now add in more "else IFs" to the conditional, so that the
   program now will handle strawberry ice cream, and both of the topping 
   choices.  
   
Version 6:

   Check the program for conformance with coding standards.  Make any corrections,
   and thoroughly re-test.

   
Version 7:

   Check the program for comments.  Are they grammatically correct?  Are there enough
   that you will be able to quickly understand the program when later work orders
   come through requesting changes to the program?  Ask yourself: Am I willing to 
   have my professional reputation rest on this program, when in the near future
   other members of my project team review what I have done?
