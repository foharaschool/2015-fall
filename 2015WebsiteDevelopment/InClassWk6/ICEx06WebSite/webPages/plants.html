  <h3 id="apone">Flower Selection Advice:</h3> 

  <p><b>Don&#039;t Import Plants from Overseas.</b> If you see a plant that looks pretty in an overseas website, check with an expert before ordering and planting the plant in your garden. It might turn out to be one of those <em>invasive</em> species that spreads, and then everyone in your neighborhood will be unfriendly toward you for years.</p>

  <p><b>Match Plants to Sunlight.</b> Read the labels on plant packages and plant them to match their sunlight requirements.</p>

  <p><b>Consider Blooming Times.</b> If you wish to have flowers blooming throughout the warm weather months, make sure the blooming times are spread over all the summer months.</p>

  <p><b>Water Plants as Needed.</b> If it doesn&#039;t rain for a long time, water your plants in the early morning or in the evenings. </p> 

  <p><b>Fertilize Appropriately.</b> Check with the experts at the plant store before fertilizing plants. Some fertiilzers might produce a lot of stem growth but inhibit flowering.</p>
