    <h2>About Artists of the World</h2>
    
    <h3>Question: What is Artists of the World?</h3>

    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Artists of the World is a non-profit organization that connects artisans and crafters from
    around the world directly to the customer.  It provides an income to struggling artists and
    provides high-quality, low cost art and handicrafts to the customer.  The customer saves money
    by eliminating the markup costs of retail establishments.</p>
    
    <h3>Question: Does Artists of the World charge the artists when a sale is made?</h3>
    
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> No. The sale is made directly between the seller and the buyer.  Artists of the World
    provides the service for free.  From time to time artisans send a donation for the maintenance of
    the Web site and Internet service provider fees.  This is entirely optional since for many of the
    artisans this is their only source of income.
    
    <h3>Question: Who are the artists?  Are any of them corporations?</h3>
    
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Most of the artists are people from poorer communities but with rich traditions, working
    to earn a living, often in developing countries.  Artists of the World does not allow corporations
    to sell goods on their site.  Developing nations may use cooperatives representing a group of
    artists.
    
    <h3>Question: Who maintains the Web site?</h3>
    
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Mostly volunteers and students.  We use student interns for much of the actual Web site
    construction and maintenance as well as maintaining the database. 
    
    <h3>Question: Do you accept volunteers, and if so, how does one apply?</h3>
    
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Yes, we do accept the services of volunteers and have a limited number of student
    internships available from time to time.  Please contact us at development@artedelmundo.com.
    
    <h3>Question: Does Artists of the World accept donations?</h3>
    
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> By all means!  We are a registered charity and all contributions are tax deductible in the
    United States.  Receipts are provided for all donations. Please contact us at
    donations@artedelmundo.com.</p>
