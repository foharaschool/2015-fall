    <h2 class="centerShadowText">Who We Are</h2>
    <p>Arte Del Mundo<sup>&reg;</sup> is a non-profit service that allows individual local artists and    craftspersons around the world 
        to be able to market their products directly to a global audience. These fine products are handcrafted and are 
        of the highest quality. You avoid the high markup costs of retail stores when you purchase directly from the 
        artist that produces the goods. Note that this website is informational only. All sales are made directly via 
        the artists themselves. Weâ€™re here to facilitate and inform.</p>
    <p>Arte Del Mundo people are in two general categories.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>First and foremost are the artists themselves, known as Member Artists</li>
        <li>Secondly, there is a lage group of important people, people who like to help Arte Del Mundo grow and prosper.
            These are officially Friends&nbsp;of&nbsp;Arte&nbsp;Del&nbsp;Mundo (more about Friends <a href = "friendsInfo.html">here</a>).
            Please consider becoming a Friend.
