        <h2>The Cost is Minimal and the Benefits are Many!</h2>
        <p>The cost to be a Friend is only 20 USD per year, and provides some nice benefits beyond just the satisfaction
           of knowing you are helping local artists fulfill their dreams:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Friends receive a quarterly newsletter by email. Fascinating articles give friends the latest in art news, as well as an inside look at the lives and secrets of our family of artists. Amaze your in-person friends at your next gathering with your detailed knowledge of the secrets of hand-woven tapestries, hand-dipped candles, and so much more. To be a Friend is to have a whole new world open to you, one artist at a time.</li>
            <li>Friends receive email notifications about all new products approximately two weeks prior to their public posting on this site.</li>
            <li>Friends may opt to meet in person at Friends events, if a group has been started in your area.</li>
