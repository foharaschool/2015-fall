    <h3>Danger:</h3> 

    <p>Unless it is a Grizzly bear, it is mostly vegetarian.  Thus, you will not be considered a source of food for the bear. Just look it right in the eye to let it know you are not afraid, and then back slowly away.</p>
  
    <p>In the spring, if a bear has a cub nearby, it will attack to protect the cub.  Never approach a bear cub, no matter how cute.</p>
